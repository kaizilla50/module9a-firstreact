# Module 9A - Build Your First React Component

## Description
This is a React app created using Vite that renders a UserProfile component. The component includes a name, bio, and image styled with inline CSS. The project demonstrates how to create and display a simple reusable React component inside a Vite application.

## What I Learned
- How to set up a React project using Vite  
- How to write and structure a functional React component  
- How to use JSX and inline styles  
- How to render a component in App.jsx  

## Challenges
At first, I had trouble getting the profile image to display correctly and understanding how to connect the UserProfile component to App.jsx. I also ran into a Git issue when pushing the project because the remote repository already contained a README file. I solved these problems by updating the image URL, checking my import statements, and resolving the Git merge conflict before pushing my code.
